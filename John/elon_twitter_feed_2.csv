13," Indeed. Both Cook &amp; I have been clear publicly that we have never spoken or otherwise communicated. I tried to speak to him &amp; he declined. 

Nor have I ever expressed any interest in running Apple to anyone. Cook is, all things considered, obviously doing an incredible job.",0.4625,0.25,Positve

16,"  Thatâ€™s arguably a security issue, but  allowing companies to use other payment options, especially for in-app purchases would be fair.

As soon as they allowed that, they would have to lower their fees.

They are just obviously overcharging with App Store. I mean 30% fees for doing almost zero incremental work is completely unreasonable.
